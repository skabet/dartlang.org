Choose from one or more of these step-by-step introductions to
writing Dart code.

[Avast, Ye Pirates: Write a Web App](darrrt/)
: Learn Dart language and library features while you
build a pirate badge generator
that runs in any modern browser.

[Weigh Anchor: Deploy a Server and App](deploy/)
: Build a Dart web server that responds to HTTP requests,
and then deploy it (and the pirate badge generator) to the web.

[Code Lab: AngularDart](https://github.com/angular/ng-darrrt-codelab#code-lab-angulardart)
: An Angular approach to the "Avast, Ye Pirates" code lab.
Use AngularDart to create custom controllers, components, and more
that let you concentrate on your application's logic,
and not on DOM manipulation.
The app is still the pirate badge generator,
but its code is completely different.

Once you've finished the code labs,

Tracking server-side performance, using the [Dart VM](/tools/dart-vm/) and the
[dart:io](https://api.dartlang.org/apidocs/channels/stable/dartdoc-viewer/dart-io)
library.

The [Dart Performance](/performance/) page tracks raw VM performance.

Benchmark descriptions
: We are currently showing charts for the three HTTP server benchmarks
  *Hello*, *File* and *JSON*. These benchmarks are tracked as part of the
  [ton80](https://github.com/dart-lang/ton80)
  benchmarking suite. For all benchmarks, we track requests-per-second,
  average latency and max latency.

  * [Hello](https://github.com/dart-lang/ton80/tree/master/lib/src/Serve/dart/server.dart)
  is a simply HTTP server, responding the string "world" to all requests. This
  benchmark is showing the peek requests-per-second, for HTTP server running
  a single isolate.

  * [File](https://github.com/dart-lang/ton80/tree/master/lib/src/Serve/dart/server.dart)
  is a HTTP server that responds with the content of a 100kb file. This
  benchmark is mostly bound by file I/O.

  * [JSON](https://github.com/dart-lang/ton80/tree/master/lib/src/Serve/dart/server.dart)
  is a HTTP server that responds with the a dynamically generated JSON string,
  for each request. This benchmark reflects some REST-like APIs, where it's
  common to JSON-encode the response.

About latency
: * *Avg latency* is the average latency recorded for all requests sent. For a
  single request, latency is the time passed from initiating the request to the
  full response has been received.

  * *Max latency* is the worst latency recorded, for all requests sent. While
  the average latency is closely bound to the requests-per-second, max latency
  indicate the HTTP servers ability to schedule fairly under heavy load.

System setup
: The benchmarks are run on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2400 CPU @ 3.10GHz
  processor running the Ubuntu 12.04 LTS x64 operating system.
  While the code runs on a 64-bit operating system, weâ€™re
  running the 32-bit version the Dart VM.

Will there be more benchmarks?
: Yes. As more benchmarks become ready, we will publish more charts.
